## Error Handling
The API may return various error responses:

Status Code	Meaning	Suggested Handling
401 Unauthorized	Missing or invalid API key	Ensure your API key is correct and included in headers
403 Forbidden	You don’t have permission	Check your API plan and request limits
404 Not Found	Resource doesn’t exist	Double-check the endpoint or parameters
429 Too Many Requests	Rate limit exceeded	Implement retries and respect rate limits
500 Internal Server Error	Server-side issue	Retry after a few seconds or report issue

### Best Practices for Error Handling:

Always check the response status code.

Use try-catch blocks in your code to handle errors gracefully.

Log errors for debugging and troubleshooting.

Usage Limits and Best Practices
Rate Limits:
Depending on your subscription tier, rate limits apply (e.g., 500 requests/day for free plans).

Best Practices:

Always cache frequent queries to reduce API calls.

Implement exponential backoff on 429 and 500 errors.
